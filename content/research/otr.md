This project aims to design personalized, data-driven policy recommendations for education programs, for example, math course-taking plans in high school. We leverage recent advances in personalized medicine, known as optimal (dynamic) treatment regimes, to recommend the best treatment option for each individual in a way that maximizes a desirable educational outcome. In addition to optimizing utility, we incorporate critical considerations such as feasibility, interpretability, and fairness into the recommendation models. 

This work is supported by NSFâ€™s EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program.
