This project introduces a novel approach for generating synthetic data using generative AI (GenAI) to provide more accurate evaluations of existing and new quantitative methods in real-world settings. Our framework consists of five key steps: (i) pre-processing input data, (ii) training GenAI models on input data, (iii) assessing synthetic data quality, (iv) conducting AI-based simulations, and (v) evaluating simulation results. Our original work on this project can be found below.
