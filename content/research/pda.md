This research examines how to incorporate process data for research on measurement and causal inference. Specifically, we extplore: 
- (i)	evaluating testing accommodations using process data from large-scale educational assessments and high-stakes testing,
- (ii)	measuring test-taking effort using process data from the same settings, and
- (iii)	developing causal inference methods with process data in a functional format.

These projects are supported in part by TC Provostâ€™s Faculty Collaboration Funds.
